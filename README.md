# challenge-salary-prediction

## Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to predict salaries based on features such as age, gender, education level, job title, years of experience, and job descriptions. This is a regression task.

### Mandatory Features:

The challenge have some mandatory features:
- Load and preprocess the dataset using Pandas / Polars or similar tools.
- Perform feature transformations on the input dataset to derive useful numerical features from the model.
- Develop a predictive model using a machine learning library such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics. Explaining why that metric was useful.
- Compare the model results against a sensible baseline â€“ e.g. a DummyRegressor
- All the metrics should be reported as intervals, not as single estimates. See references on how to calculate confidence intervals for ML.
- Structure the code in modules . See the reference to know what is expected.
- Present the final result in a Jupyter Notebook which should:
  - Have a Table of Contents at the top.
  - Contain explanatory text in markdown, properly formatted.
  - Have no big blocks of code, instead it should import the functionality from the modules and only have initial configuration.
  - Include illustrations or images showing the results.

#### Optional Features ( just the ones we have implemented):
- Validate the model using cross-validation techniques. (3)
- Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable (4). Included in the EDA. (4)
- Use an interpretation tool to explain the contribution of each feature - e.g. SHAP (5)
- Use a more advanced model such as Random Forest, or Neural Networks. (6)
- Lock your dependencies - e.g., using pipenv, uv or pdm. (8)


## Data

The dataset contains three files:
- `salary.csv`: Contains the target variable (Salary)
- `people.csv`: Contains features about individuals
- `descriptions.csv`: Contains textual descriptions ( NOT USED!!)

Dataset involves both numerical and categorical variables

## Project Structure

Kedro was used to structure the code.

The project have three different pipelines

- data_processing: responsible for loading and preprocessing the data
  - pp_common: common preprocessing steps
  - pp_v1: preprocessing steps for version 1
  - pp_v2: preprocessing steps for version 2 ( a more advanced version of the preprocessing )
- data_science: responsible for training the model
- reporting: responsible for reporting the results

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/cristianrohr/challenge-prediction-salary.git`
2. Create a virtual environment
`python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment
`source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the EDA notebook
`jupyter notebook notebooks/01_EDA.ipynb`
6. Run the Kedro pipeline
`kedro run`

Run V1 Only:
Set preprocessing_version_to_run: "v1" in parameters_data_processing.yml (optional, for documentation/clarity).

Execute: `kedro run --pipeline=full_v1`
This runs pp_common, pp_v1, then only the data science nodes tagged uses_pp_v1, and finally reporting.

Run V2 Only:
Set preprocessing_version_to_run: "v2" in parameters_data_processing.yml (optional).
Execute: `kedro run --pipeline=full_v2`
This runs pp_common, pp_v2, then only the data science nodes tagged uses_pp_v2, and finally reporting.

Run Both (Default Behavior):
Set preprocessing_version_to_run: "both" in parameters_data_processing.yml.
Execute: `kedro run` (runs __default__, which we mapped to full_both)
Or explicitly: `kedro run --pipeline=full_both`

This runs pp_common, pp_v1, pp_v2, all data science nodes (ds_full), and finally reporting.

## Methodology

Kedro was used to structure de code.

### EDA

Exploratory data analsysis. First a fast EDA was performed in the notebooks/01_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb

### Baseline model

As suggested a DummyRegressor was implemented as the baseline model

### Metrics

In order to evaluate the models some regression metrics were selected

 - MSE (Mean Squared Error): Average squared difference between the predicted and real salaries.
 - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Square root of MSE.
 - R2 (R-squared): Proportion of variace in salary explained by the model.
